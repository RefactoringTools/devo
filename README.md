Deevo -- Online SD Erlang Profiling and Visualisation
=====================================================

To compile the code you need rebar in your PATH.

Type the following command:
```
$ make
```

You can then start the online visualisation from an Erlang node with the following command:
```
deevo:start().
```

Then point your browser to the indicated URL to open the Deevo visualisation page.

To stop the application, type:
```
deevo:stop().
```

This is still a prototype.
