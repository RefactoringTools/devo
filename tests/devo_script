

step1: update devo.

cd devo
git pull
make

cd tests
erlc *.erl


step2. start the five worker nodes. (need five terminal emulators)

cd tests
./start.sh node1@127.0.0.1

cd tests
./start.sh node2@127.0.0.1

cd tests
./start.sh node3@127.0.0.1

cd tests
./start.sh node4@127.0.0.1

cd tests
./start.sh node5@127.0.0.1


We'll run the test code on node1, leave all the other nodes there.


step3: start devo node on another window.

cd devo

./start.sh

goto localhost:8080


step4: run the visualisation.

For the first three options, only one node can be monitored a time.

1) add node1@127.0.0.1
2) select one of the first three options.
3) click node1@127.0.1 in the node list to highlight it. 
4) click start/stop visualisation.

now go to node1@127.0.0.1 and type

orbit:run()

you should be able to see the digram.
